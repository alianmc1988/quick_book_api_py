# Quick Book FastAPI

The reservation system (for a hotel or restaurant) is an application that allows users to make reservations, check availability, and manage existing bookings. Here is a general approach to designing the architecture and key considerations for a reservation system.

## Features

1. System Requirements
  Functional:
  Reservation Management: Users can make reservations for a restaurant, hotel, or any service with limited availability.
  Availability Check: Users can see available time slots/days for reservations.
  Reservation Confirmation: Users receive an email or notification confirming their booking.
  User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their reservations.
  Cancellation & Modification: Users can cancel or modify reservations within certain restrictions.
  Reservation History: Users can view past reservations.
  Non-functional:
  Scalability: The system should handle a high number of concurrent reservations without performance issues.
  High Availability: The system should be fault-tolerant and allow reservations 24/7.
  Security: User data must be protected, especially when handling payments or sensitive information.
